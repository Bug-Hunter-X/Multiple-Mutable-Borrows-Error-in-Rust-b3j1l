This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable borrowing.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create multiple mutable references to the same variable, resulting in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to fix the issue.  Understanding mutable borrows is crucial for writing safe and correct Rust code.  This example highlights the importance of the borrow checker in preventing data races.
